## Data Dictionary

### Overview
Data was retrieved from the [US Social Security Administration website](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). The National level and State level data provided by the US SSA was used to create a single dataset for analysis.
1. National-level data: consisted of text files of popular baby names in the US, for each year between 1880 and 2019. 
2. State-specific data: consisted of text files of popular baby names for each state, between 1910 and 2019. 

The text files available on the US SSA website were used to create 3 datasets.
1. popularBabyNames.csv
2. popularBabyNames_National.csv
3. popularBabyNames_State.csv
