## Data Dictionary

### Overview
Data was retrieved from the [US Social Security Administration website](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). The National level and State level data provided by the US SSA was used to create two main datasets for analysis.
1. National-level data: consisted of text files of popular baby names in the US, for each year between 1880 and 2019. 
2. State-specific data: consisted of text files of popular baby names for each state, between 1910 and 2019. 

The text files available on the US SSA website were used to create 3 datasets (#2 and #3 were the primary datasets used in the final analysis).
1. popularBabyNames_National.csv :  Popular baby names across the US from 1880 - 2019
2. popularBabyNames_State.csv : Popular baby names by state from 1910 - 2019
3. popularBabyNames.csv : Combines National dataset (#1) and State dataset (#2) into a single dataset containing most popular baby names. 

The data dictionary below is for the main datasets that was used in this analysis (popularBabyNames.csv & popularBabyNames_State.csv). Additional fields that were created in Tableau are highlighted in blue.
