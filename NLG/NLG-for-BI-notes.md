# NLG for BI Notes

There are several products that enable users to leverage NLG in their dashboards. Many NLG products are available as plug-ins for Business-Intelligence (BI) tools. Generating written narratives from a dataset, and providing written answers to questions asked by users, are two ways in which dashboards can incorporate NLG. A few examples of NLG products available for BI tools include:
- Arria for BI and Arria NLG Studio by Arria NLG
- Wordsmith by Automated Insights  
- Quill by Narrative Science, A Salesforce Company
- Augmented Business Intelligence by Yseop

Organizations leveraging NLG in their dashboards can experience several benefits such as: 
- <b>Time and Cost Reduction</b> - Developers can spend a significant amount of time sharing dashboard insights to various groups. NLG can help developers and end users save time. Developers can reduce the time it takes to share updates and dashboard insights. While end users can gain quality and easy-to-understand insights with minimal guidance.
- <b>Increased User Adoption</b> - One reason dashboards aren't used is because users have trouble retrieving insights immediately. NLG can help users gain context, key insights, and a high-level summary of the data quickly through text.
- <b>Enable Data Driven Decision Making</b> -Dashboards leveraging NLG capabilities empower users to make decisions with their data. Users are able to gain tailored insights based on their view, and in real-time as the data is updated.
